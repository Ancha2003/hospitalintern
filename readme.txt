# **Hospital Management System (Patient & Doctor Dashboard)**

## **Project Overview**

This Hospital Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage patients, doctors, appointments, and prescriptions efficiently. It allows:

* Patients to register, update their profile, upload avatars, submit health problems, and send details to doctors.
* Doctors to view appointments, access patient details, and manage prescriptions.
* Upload and view reports, prescriptions, and patient avatars, which persist even after page refresh.

The system is built using **React.js for the frontend**, **Node.js & Express for the backend**, and **MongoDB** as the database.

## **Installation & Setup**

### **Backend Setup**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start MongoDB (local or Atlas):

```bash
mongod
```

4. Run the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

* The backend server runs on **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**
* Uploaded files are stored in `uploads/avatars` and `uploads/reports` directories.

---

### **Frontend Setup**

1. Navigate to frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

* The frontend runs on **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
* Axios is configured to communicate with the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.

## **API Endpoints**

### **Patients**

* `GET /patients/me?id=<patientId>` – Get current patient details.
* `PUT /patients/:id` – Update patient info or avatar (supports file upload).
* `POST /patients/send` – Send problem and avatar to a doctor (create appointment).

### **Appointments**

* `GET /appointments` – Fetch all appointments.
* `PATCH /appointments/:id/status` – Update appointment status (completed/cancelled).
* `POST /appointments/:id/upload-report` – Upload report file for an appointment.

### **Prescriptions**

* `GET /prescriptions/appointment/:appointmentId` – Get prescription for an appointment.
* Add/Edit prescriptions through frontend forms.

## **Usage**

1. **Patient Dashboard**

   * Login using patient ID (for simplicity) or implement authentication.
   * Upload avatar → it will be saved in `uploads/avatars/`.
   * Submit problem and send to doctor → appointment created.
   * Upload medical reports for appointments → saved in `uploads/reports/`.

2. **Doctor Dashboard**

   * View patient appointments with avatar and problem details.
   * Filter appointments by status.
   * Add, edit, or view prescriptions.
   * Manage appointment status.

---

## **Key Notes**

* All uploaded files persist on the server and database, so refreshing the page will not remove images.
* Avatar and report URLs are stored in MongoDB and served statically from `/uploads/`.
* Supports multiple appointment statuses: pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled.
* Axios requests include a timestamp query `?_t=${Date.now()}` to prevent caching issues.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

* Add authentication using JWT.
* Integrate real-time notifications for doctors/patients.
* Enhance frontend UI with Tailwind or Material UI.
* Implement role-based access: patient vs doctor.
* Add email notifications for appointment updates.
